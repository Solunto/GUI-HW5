This project was a fun one to work on.

As far as I can tell I got all the functionality working, but I did not do anything for extra credit.

I'm not sure what the professor was referring to when she talked about $('this') vs. $(this), so I
might have done this project differently than is typical? Or maybe she just meant that in the
statement $(this) the word "this" is reserved and is not a string literal? IDK!


Thanks for your hard work this semester, Ben!
